# Robust Frontend Boilerplate

## Description
When I start a project, I always want to spend a minimum of time on the preparatory stage.
That is why the boilerplates were developed, as well as a small CLI for automated start.

### Boilerplate

- âšª [Native Application](native)
- ðŸ”µ [React Application](react)

## How to use?

> Check out and select the boilerplate you need (each of them is in its own folder).

### Step 1

Clone the repositor:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/viczhuravlev/robust-frontend-boilerplate.git NAME_YOUR_REPOSITORY
```

### Step 2

Run CLI, which will help you prepare the boilerplate you need and install dependencies:

```sh
$ yarn start
```

### Step 3

Follow the setup instructions in the boilerplate of your choice.
